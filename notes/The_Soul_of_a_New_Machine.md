## Quotations

> Up until that year when he discovered the machine, his life, every way he had looked at it had seemed chaotic. He had done fairly well in a course of psychology, but in nothing else. He had proven to himself that he was an inveterate failure. Now, finally, he felt truly interested in something. He left college for a year. When he came back, he took a number of courses in electrical engineering and became a straight-A student.
