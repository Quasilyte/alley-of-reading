# The Soul of a New Machine

For me, this book was something like an inspiration source to me. This is why most quotations from the book can look like they don't make a lot of sense. They do, to me.

## Quotations

> Up until that year when he discovered the machine, his life, every way he had looked at it had seemed chaotic. He had done fairly well in a course of psychology, but in nothing else. He had proven to himself that he was an inveterate failure. Now, finally, he felt truly interested in something. He left college for a year. When he came back, he took a number of courses in electrical engineering and became a straight-A student.

> It's commonplace today for programmers to stick exclusively to high-level languages and never look inside their machines. Alsing felt that they were missing something. He remembered learning assembly language during his time of midnight programming. "It was neat to learn it. I could skip the middleman and talk right to the machine. I could talk to God, just like IBM".

> A classmate at Amherst remembered West as "smart — off the charts — but also naive. No, not exactly naive, but like a boy — uh, romantic. He believed in pie in the sky."
